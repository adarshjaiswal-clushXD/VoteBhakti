# 🗳️ VoteBhakti – A Decentralized Voting Smart Contract

> A simple blockchain-based voting system built using **Solidity** and deployed on the **Celo Sepolia Testnet**.

## 📖 Project Description

**VoteBhakti** is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows anyone to create and participate in transparent, tamper-proof voting events.  
It eliminates the need for a central authority by using smart contracts on the blockchain, ensuring that votes are **secure, public, and verifiable**.

This project is ideal for **beginners learning Solidity**, as it covers the fundamental concepts of:
- Smart contract structure  
- Data storage (mappings, structs, arrays)  
- Access control (admin functions)  
- Event logging  
- Public view functions  

---

## ⚙️ What It Does

1. The **admin (deployer)** creates and controls the voting process.  
2. The admin can **add candidates** before the voting starts.  
3. Once ready, the admin **starts the voting phase**.  
4. Any user can **cast one vote** for any candidate.  
5. The admin can **end the voting** when the poll is complete.  
6. Anyone can check **who is leading** or **view total votes** anytime.

All data is stored on the blockchain, making the system **immutable** and **transparent**.

---

## 🌟 Features

✅ **Add Candidates:** Admin can register new candidates before voting begins.  
✅ **Start/End Voting:** Only admin controls when voting starts and stops.  
✅ **One Person, One Vote:** Each address can vote only once.  
✅ **View Candidates:** Anyone can view candidate details and vote counts.  
✅ **Check Winner:** Instantly find out which candidate has the most votes.  
✅ **Public Transparency:** All information is verifiable directly on-chain.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Solidity (v0.8.x)** – Smart contract language  
- **Remix IDE** – For writing and deploying the contract  
- **Celo Testnet (Sepolia)** – Blockchain network  
- **MetaMask** – Wallet to deploy and interact  

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org)  
2. Create a new file named `VoteBhakti.sol`  
3. Paste the Solidity code into it  
4. Compile using **Solidity Compiler 0.8.x**  
5. Deploy using **Injected Provider – MetaMask (Celo Testnet)**  
6. Interact with your contract functions under the “Deployed Contracts” section
